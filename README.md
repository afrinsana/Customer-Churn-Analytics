# 📊 Customer Churn Analytics

> **Predict, Prevent, and Power Up Business Retention.**

Welcome to **Customer Churn Analytics**, your smart gateway to understanding why customers leave and how to stop them in real time!  
This end-to-end industry-grade project uses real-world data, advanced Machine Learning, live API simulations, PostgreSQL integration, explainable AI (SHAP), and an elegant Streamlit web app. 🚀

🔎 Whether you're analyzing customer loyalty or fine-tuning retention strategies, this project gives you the full data power you need.

## Project Highlights:

- *Real-world dataset* used (no toy examples or dummy numbers).
- *End-to-end system* from model training to live deployment.
- *Live API simulation* to mimic real customer inputs.
- *Database Integration* using *PostgreSQL* — every prediction is securely stored.
- *Explainable AI* with *SHAP* — understand the "why" behind each prediction.
- *Streamlit App* for simple, intuitive user interaction.
- *Industry-Ready* — clean code, scalable architecture, deployment-friendly.

## How to Run Locally:

1. *Clone the repo*  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Analytics.git
cd Customer-Churn-Analytics

2.	Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3.	Install all requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

4.	Start the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py

Why This Project Stands Out:

“It doesn’t just predict churn — it explains it, stores it, and simulates it.”

This is not just a machine learning model; it’s a full customer intelligence system. Built to impress recruiters, managers, clients — and your future self.

Sneak Peek:

Imagine knowing why a customer would leave, before they even think about it.
That’s the magic we’re bottling here.
